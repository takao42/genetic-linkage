# genetic-linkage

This python module can be used to produce multiple progenies from two genes.

##Explanation
cross - crosses two genes and produces multiple progenies<br>
crossParallel - multi threading version of cross. usually 2-3 times as fast as the single threading one<br>
cross1 - crosses two genes and produces one progeny

##Dependency
sudo pip install numpy

Compiled with Python 2.7<br>
I don't recommend using Python 3 because it is slower than python 2.
